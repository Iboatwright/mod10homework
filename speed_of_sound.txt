Chapter 11 Programming Exercise 7. The Speed of Sound
The following table shows the approximate speed of sound in air, water,
and steel.

    Medium      Speed
    ------      -----
    Air         1,100 feet per second
    Water       4,900 feet per second
    Steel       16,400 feet per second

Design a program that displays a menu allowing the user to select air,
water, or steel. After the user has made a selection, he or she should
be asked to enter the number of seconds the sound will travel in the
selected medium. The program should then display the distance the sound
will travel.

Pseudocode
----------
Module main()
    // Local variables
    Declare String mediums[3] = 'Air', 'Water', 'Steel'
    Declare Integer speeds[3] = 1100, 4900, 16400

    Declare Integer option = 0

    While endProgram == 'no'
        Declare Integer soundTime = 0
        Declare Integer soundDistance = 0
        // Function calls
        Set option = Input '1) Air\n2) Water\n3) Steel\n\n' \
                           'Please select the medium: >> '

        Set soundTime = Input 'Please enter the number of seconds the' \
                              'sound traveled: >> '

        Set soundDistance = calcDistance(speeds[option - 1], soundTime)

        displayInfo(medium[option - 1], soundTime, soundDistance)

		Display “Do you want to end the program? Yes or no”
		Input endProgram
	End While
End Module


Function calcDistance(Integer speed, Integer time)
    Return speed * time
End Function


Module displayInfo(String medium, Integer time, Integer distance)
    Display "If sound vibrations were traveling for " + time + " through "
            + medium + ". It would travel " + distance + " feet."
End Module
